## 🌍 1. Background and Context

Cigarette butts are among the **most commonly littered items worldwide**. Even though they look small and harmless, they are made of **cellulose acetate**, a type of plastic that breaks down very slowly. A single cigarette butt can release a mixture of chemicals, including:

- Nicotine  
- Heavy metals  
- Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)  
- Tar and other additives  

Because of their size and frequency, cigarette butts represent a **serious pollution source** on streets, beaches, rivers, lakes, and around campuses. They are not just an aesthetic problem but also a **toxic and persistent environmental pollutant**.

---

## 📘 2. About the Paper

**Title:** *Toxicity of cigarette butts, and their chemical components to marine and freshwater fish*  
**Authors:** Slaughter et al.  
**Journal:** Tobacco Control  
**Year:** 2011  

The paper focuses on how **cigarette butts and their chemical leachates affect fish** in both marine and freshwater environments. The authors investigate:

- Whether the leachate (chemicals released into water) from cigarette butts is toxic to fish  
- How quickly toxic effects appear  
- Whether the filter alone, or the combination of filter + tobacco, is responsible for toxicity  

---

## 🔬 3. Methodology (How the Study Was Conducted)

The study used **laboratory experiments** to simulate what happens when cigarette butts end up in water.

### Main Steps:

1. **Preparation of Cigarette Butt Leachates**
   - Used smoked cigarette butts were collected.
   - These butts were soaked in water to create a **leachate solution** (water containing chemicals released from the butts).

2. **Test Species**
   - One **freshwater** fish species  
   - One **marine** fish species  
   These species were chosen because they are relatively sensitive and can represent broader aquatic environments.

3. **Exposure Experiments**
   - Fish were placed in tanks with different concentrations of cigarette butt leachates.
   - Control groups were kept in clean water without leachates.

4. **Toxicity Measurement**
   - The researchers monitored:
     - Fish behavior  
     - Signs of stress or damage  
     - Survival or mortality over a period of **48–96 hours**  
   - They determined the **LC50 (Lethal Concentration 50%)**, which is the concentration at which 50% of the fish die.

This approach allowed the researchers to quantify how dangerous cigarette butt pollution can be to aquatic life in a controlled environment.

---

## 🔎 4. Detailed Key Findings

### 4.1 Toxicity at Low Concentrations

One of the most striking results is that **even low concentrations of cigarette butt leachate** were enough to cause significant harm to fish.

- Water that had been in contact with a **small number of cigarette butts** caused mortality in fish within a relatively short time frame (48–96 hours).  
- This shows that **you do not need a large number of butts** to create a toxic environment.

👉 **Key idea:** A single cigarette butt in a small volume of water can already be dangerous for aquatic organisms.

---

### 4.2 Role of Filters and Tobacco Remnants

Many people think that only the tobacco or ash is harmful, but the study reveals a more complex picture:

- **Filters alone** (even when tobacco has been removed) still release toxic substances.  
- When **filters + tobacco remnants** are present, toxicity increases further.  

This means:

- Cigarette filters are not “clean plastic” but **contaminated plastic** that acts as a carrier for various chemicals.  
- They should not be considered harmless once the cigarette is smoked.

---

### 4.3 Cigarette Butts as Microplastic Pollution

The study also adds to the understanding of cigarette butts as a **form of plastic pollution**:

- Filters are made from **cellulose acetate**, a semi-synthetic plastic.  
- These filters do not biodegrade quickly; they **fragment into smaller pieces over time**.  
- As they break down, they contribute to **microplastic pollution** in aquatic environments.

Microplastics can:

- Be ingested by small organisms  
- Move up the food chain  
- Potentially reach humans through seafood and drinking water sources  

Therefore, cigarette butts are part of the broader **microplastic and plastic pollution crisis**.

---

### 4.4 Physiological Effects on Fish

The paper describes several ways in which the leachates from cigarette butts affect fish:

- **Behavioral changes:** Reduced mobility, abnormal swimming, signs of distress  
- **Tissue and organ effects:** Damage to gills and possible nervous system impacts  
- **Survival:** High levels of mortality at certain concentrations  

These effects confirm that cigarette butt leachates are not simply irritating but **genuinely toxic**.

---

### 4.5 Ecotoxicological Implications

Based on the experimental evidence, the authors argue that:

- Cigarette butts should be treated as **hazardous waste**, not ordinary litter.  
- The presence of cigarette butts in rivers, lakes, and coastal areas poses **ecotoxicological risks** to aquatic ecosystems.  
- Since many fish species are ecologically and economically important, this has potential consequences for **biodiversity, fisheries, and food security**.

---

## 🌐 5. Why This Matters Beyond the Lab

While the study was conducted in controlled lab conditions, the findings have strong real-world implications:

- Cigarette butts are extremely common in urban areas, beaches, and near waterways.  
- Rain can easily wash cigarette butts from streets and campuses into **storm drains, streams, and rivers**, eventually reaching larger bodies of water.  
- The same toxic effects observed in the lab can occur in natural environments, potentially affecting many species over time.  

In other words, this is **not just a theoretical problem**. It connects directly to how we manage waste and behave in outdoor spaces—**including our campus**.

---

## 🏫 6. Why Addressing Cigarette Butt Pollution Is Important and Necessary for Our Campus

The paper helps us understand why cigarette butt pollution is **not only a global issue, but also a campus issue**.

### 6.1 Environmental Quality on Campus

- Our campus likely has **green areas, gardens, parks, walkways, and drainage systems**.  
- When cigarette butts are discarded on the ground:
  - Rainwater can carry their leachates into soil and campus drainage.  
  - Toxins may accumulate in local soil and water, potentially affecting plants and microorganisms.

Maintaining a healthy campus environment means **preventing the introduction of avoidable toxins** like those from cigarette butts.

---

### 6.2 Microplastics and Long-Term Pollution

Since filters are made of a plastic-like material:

- They **do not disappear quickly**.  
- Over time, they fragment into **microfibers and microplastic particles**.  

On campus, this can lead to:

- Microplastics in soil (affecting soil quality and organisms)  
- Microplastics in stormwater systems, which eventually connect to larger waterways outside the campus  

This contradicts any campus commitment to **sustainability** and **environmental responsibility**.

---

### 6.3 Risks to Local Wildlife and Biodiversity

Many campuses host various forms of wildlife, such as:

- Birds  
- Squirrels or small mammals  
- Insects and other small animals  

Risks include:

- Animals may **mistake cigarette butts for food**.  
- Ingested filters can cause:
  - Internal blockages  
  - Poisoning from chemicals  
  - Reduced fitness or death  

The toxicity demonstrated in the paper for fish suggests that **other species are likely vulnerable as well**, especially if they ingest or come into contact with cigarette butts.

---

### 6.4 Social, Aesthetic and Educational Dimensions

Cigarette butt litter also affects the **social and visual quality** of the campus:

- Sidewalks, benches, building entrances and green areas covered with cigarette butts create a sense of neglect.  
- It sends the message that **littering is tolerated**, which can encourage more littering.  
- For a place of education, this contradicts the idea of being a **role model for responsible behavior**.

As an academic institution, the campus should demonstrate:

- Respect for shared spaces  
- Awareness of environmental impacts  
- Alignment between **what we teach about sustainability** and **how we manage our environment**

---

### 6.5 Sustainability Goals and Institutional Responsibility

Many universities and campuses have:

- Sustainability strategies  
- Environmental clubs and initiatives  
- Goals for reducing waste and pollution  

Ignoring cigarette butt pollution would be inconsistent with such goals.  
Addressing this issue is important because:

- It is **visible**, **measurable**, and **actionable**.  
- Simple changes (more ashtrays, awareness campaigns, enforcement of no-litter policies) can lead to **significant improvements**.

👉 **In summary:**  
Addressing cigarette butt pollution on campus is important and necessary because it protects **environmental health, wildlife, aesthetics, and the credibility of institutional sustainability commitments**.

---

## ✅ 7. Possible Actions and Recommendations for Our Campus

Based on the findings of the paper and the discussion above, the following actions could be considered:

1. **Install dedicated cigarette butt disposal bins**
   - Near building entrances  
   - In designated smoking areas  
   - Along main walkways  

2. **Designate and clearly mark smoking areas**
   - Concentrate smoking behavior in specific zones.  
   - Make it easier to manage waste and keep other areas clean.

3. **Awareness campaigns**
   - Posters and digital materials explaining:
     - That filters are plastic  
     - That they are toxic to aquatic life  
     - That they contribute to microplastic pollution  
   - Use strong visuals and short facts from the paper to make the message memorable.

4. **Cleanup events**
   - Organize “campus clean-up days” involving students and staff.  
   - Collect and count cigarette butts to visualize the scale of the problem.

5. **Policy and enforcement**
   - Reinforce no-litter rules.  
   - Consider penalties or warnings for repeated littering.  
   - Integrate cigarette butt management into the campus sustainability plan.

6. **Integration into education**
   - Use this topic in environmental science, sustainability, or public health courses as a **real-life case study**.  
   - Encourage student projects that monitor and reduce cigarette butt litter.

## 🧾 8. Conclusion

The paper by Slaughter et al. (2011) clearly shows that:

- Cigarette butts are **toxic** to fish in both marine and freshwater environments.  
- This toxicity appears even at low concentrations and within short time periods.  
- Filters alone, even without tobacco, are significant contributors to toxicity and act as a form of **plastic and microplastic pollution**.  

For our campus, this means cigarette butt litter is not a minor or purely cosmetic issue. It is:

- A source of **chemical pollution**  
- A contributor to **microplastic contamination**  
- A **threat to local ecosystems and campus aesthetics**  

Therefore, addressing cigarette butt pollution on our campus is both **important and necessary** for environmental, social, and educational reasons.

# 📊 DiDE Data Collection Analysis and Spatial Evaluation

## **1. Objective and Motivation**

The main objective of this study is to evaluate spatial event data collected via the DiDE platform by focusing on **data quality rather than data quantity**, and to analytically determine the **most effective data collector** among users.

Instead of simply counting observations, this analysis is designed to answer the following key questions:

- How **spatially extensive** is the data collected by each user?
- Is the data collected across **multiple days**, or concentrated in a single session?
- Does the user collect **diverse types of events**?
- Are observations **spatially distributed**, or clustered in a limited area?

This approach aligns directly with the course requirement emphasizing **spatial coverage and meaningful sampling**, rather than repeatedly collecting data from closely spaced locations.

---

## **2. Data Source and Preprocessing**

The dataset used in this study is stored in a PostgreSQL + PostGIS environment within the `dide_events` table.

Each record includes:
- A geometry field (`geom`) representing the spatial location
- A `properties` JSON field containing metadata such as:
  - `created_by`
  - `created_by_id`
  - event-related attributes

SQL was used extensively to extract, aggregate, and prepare the data for analytical evaluation.

---

## **3. Initial Filtering: Identifying the Top 10 Users**

As a first step, SQL queries were used to identify the **top 10 users** based on the total number of observations.

However, the selection was **not based solely on observation count**. For each of the top 10 users, the following metrics were computed:

- **n_obs**: Total number of collected observations  
- **days_active**: Number of distinct days with data collection  
- **type_count**: Number of different event types collected  
- **bbox_area_m2**: Approximate spatial coverage area

These metrics were combined into a comprehensive summary table.

## **4. Score-Based Evaluation and Ranking**

To further refine the analysis and reduce visual complexity in later spatial visualizations, a **composite partner score** was calculated for each user.

The score incorporates weighted contributions from:
- Spatial coverage (area)
- Temporal consistency (days active)
- Data diversity (event types)
- Spatial dispersion (distance-based metrics)

After computing this score, users were ranked from highest to lowest.

At this stage:
- The user **heis** achieved the **highest overall score**
- This ranking justified narrowing the analysis to a **Top 5 user subset**

## **5. Spatial Visualization in QGIS – Map 1 (Comparative View)**

In the first map, the **Top 5 users** were visualized together on the campus map using QGIS.

Design decisions:
- Each user was assigned a **distinct color**
- All points were rendered with **equal symbol size**
- OpenStreetMap was used as the basemap

This visualization enables a direct comparison of spatial behavior and coverage.

## **6. Focused Visualization – Map 2 (Emphasis on heis)**

A second map was created to emphasize the selected partner.

In this map:
- **heis** is shown in **red**
- All other users are displayed in **light gray**
- Symbol sizes remain constant to avoid visual bias

This design highlights the spatial reach and consistency of heis relative to others.

## **7. Observational Review of Uploaded Images**

Beyond spatial metrics, the images uploaded by **heis** were manually reviewed.

The review confirmed that:
- Images are relevant to the reported event types
- Visual content is clear and informative
- Observations are contextually meaningful

This supports the conclusion that data quality extends beyond spatial distribution to include **content accuracy and clarity**.
